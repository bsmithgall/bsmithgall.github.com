title: The Utopia of Rules
excerpt: Thoughts on David Graeber's "Utopia of Rules"
---

Though I said that I was going to write a new post every month, I failed to do
so for March. So I'm writing this a few days late.

I recently read David Graeber's book [The Utopia of
Rules](https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy/dp/1612195180)
and had a number of thoughts about it. The book concerns itself with the
Bureaucracy -- how it is overwhelmingly more and more part of daily life in both
the public and private sectors of our life. Examples abound about the ways that
private corporations increasingly operate like government bureaucracy, and he
spends time thinking about why things have ended up this way:

> The vast majority of the paperwork we do exists in just this sort of
> in-between zone -- ostensibly private, but in fact entirely shaped by a
> government that provides the legal framework, underpins the rules with its
> courts and all of the elaborate mechanisms of enforcement that come with them,
> but -- crucially -- works closely with the private concerns to ensure that
> results will guarantee a certain rate of private profit.

This public/private "in-between zone" has come about for a number of reasons,
but Graeber points out that as bureaucracy has come to be a larger and larger
part of our lives, there exists a fiction surrounding the whole enterprise.
Those inside a bureaucracy do a sort of performance where they pretend
everything is based on merit but instead everything is based on an unfailing
loyalty to the organization (this notion of a false meritocracy has been [widely
discussed](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/silicon-valley-isnt-a-meritocracy-and-the-cult-of-the-entrepreneur-holds-people-back/)
in terms of how Silicon Valley operates).

So if everyone just doing this work is just putting on a performance, this
raises a secondary question: where does the bureaucracy's power come from?
Ultimately, Graeber argues convincingly that it arrives from the state monopoly
on violence. The police, he argues, are just armed bureaucrats; minor
functionaries designated to make sure everyone is properly following the rules:

> [W]hen most of us think about police, we do not think of them as enforcing

Taken together, these two thoughts show that we are living in a society where a
blurred mix of public and private bureaucracies compel us into following rules
enforced by a state monopoly on violence. Not only that, but Graeber argues that
we cannot just replace this system with another one: any major change to our
existing social order will ultimately result in the creation of "some new,
violent bureaucracy". This is because the bureaucracy is useful for political
leaders: it creates a system of rules, and theoretically binds everyone to
them where they can be treated equally.

In this way, the bureaucracy is actually a utopian project: it hopes not only
that people are able to adequately follow some set of rules, but that the
complexity of existence can be bound up into fields on a form that have a fixed
set of possible answers. Here I am reminded of something that I read recently
about software: software forcibly reduces complexity, often by forcing things
into database fields. I am reminded of falsehoods programmers believe about
[names](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/),
[time](http://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time),
and
[addresses](https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/).
All the forms that I have seen and worked with during my time in the federal
government have these properties (both the physical forms and their digital
counterparts). Graeber's point is well-taken, though: how can we imagine a
society where we do not have to make these sorts of simplifications in order to
effectively govern?

Thought this question is never answered definitively, Graeber does discuss at
length why we always come back to bureaucratic societies (and why we appear to
love them) -- the thought of their absence is frightening to us. He traces how,
throughout history, non-bureaucratic societies will sweep into and conquer
bureaucratic ones before installing a new version of rules and regulations,
retrenching themselves into the previous bureaucratic mold. Why is this? He
discusses how rules provide us not just value, but a utopian vision of equality
and fairness:

> Who hasn't dreamed of a world where everyone knows the rules, everyone plays
> by the rules, and -- even more -- where people who play by the rules can
> actually still win?

This thought is certainly bound up in modern US politics -- making "everyone
play by the same rules" was a common rhetorical refrain from President Obama.
Graeber points out, however, that this is just a utopian fantasy (hence the
title of the book): seeing the bureaucracy as a mindless power without feeling
that applies rules to all equally is a form of make-believe. There is an
interesting corollary here that I want to develop about modernization, perhaps
in another post.

In any case, this book is interesting and thought-provoking on many levels.
