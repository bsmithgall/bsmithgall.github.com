It has been awhile since I read anything by Murakami. His style is at once
strange and comforting; descriptions of cooking and eating food mixed in with
the same tone and cadence as being visited by the dead, or conversing with
a "Sheep Man."

One passage that stuck out to me was towards the beginning, where the unnamed
protagonist is talking to his business partner about a shadowy and powerful
figure known only as "The Boss:"

> "'Every company's got a secret it doesn't want exploded right in the middle of
> the annual shareholders' meeting. In most cases, they'll listen to the word
> handed down. In sum, the Boss sits squarely on top of a trilateral power base
> of politicians, information services and the stock market.'"

This reminded me quite a bit of a section in Umberto Eco's [Numero
Zero](/books/numero-zero), where the characters go on for a bit about how
publishing is quite a silly activity.

In any case, *A Wild Sheep Chase* is both bizarre and simple: easy to read and
hard to understand.
