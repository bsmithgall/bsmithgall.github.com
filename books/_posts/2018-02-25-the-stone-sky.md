A fun read and mostly satisfying conclusion to this particular trilogy. An author's note confirms a suspicion that Jemisin is writing her relationships with both her mother and her children which definitely influences the way that I perceive of this book.

Altogether, the world of this trilogy is fascinating and interesting, and the characters are well-developed and interesting. Not everything works perfectly, but the writing drives forward relentlessly. There are a handful of loose ends that are left on purpose; not everything has a neat tie-up. I enjoyed reading the trilogy despite its flaws.
