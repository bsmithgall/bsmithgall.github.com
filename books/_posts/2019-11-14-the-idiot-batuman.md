Batuman is a great writer, and it shines through here. She wrote one of my
favorite recent pieces in _The New Yorker_ about Japan's [rental
family](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry)
industry. There are individual strokes of brilliance in _The Idiot_, Batuman's dry wit
manages to poke great fun at people who Taleb would label the "Intellectual Yet
Idiot" class. In one great passage, she complains about a literature class:

> One morning, on my way to a lecture on Balzac, it came to me with great
> clarity that there was no way that that guy, the professor, was going to tell
> me anything useful. No doubt he knew many useful things, but he wasn't going
> to say them; rather, he was going to tell us again that Balzac's Paris was
> extremely comprehensive.

However, these little snippets are really all that sustains the book. We have a
number of these bizarre interstitial scenes, but overall, the book seems to
mostly just be treating water around them. The main character, Selin, seems to
be a passive receiver of the world around her. Her major acts of creation seem
to be largely bundled up in email, still a recent invention in the time when the
book was published (which leads to some fun asides about emacs and the UNIX
program `finger` that reminded me a bit of the ravings of Abulafia, the
fictional word processing software from Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_).
This leads to a major theme in the book: when you correspond to someone over
text, is that person the same as the person who you would actually meet and talk
with? Selin doesn't seem to be sure.
