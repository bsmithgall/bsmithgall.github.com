Certainly not an easy read, but full of interesting thoughts and dense with
citations. Of the four lectures, I think the most interesting is certainly about
the mysteries of nature and the limits of human understanding. An good (and
certainly simpler) explanation can be found in this [lecture
snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tBI7Y4K7k).
