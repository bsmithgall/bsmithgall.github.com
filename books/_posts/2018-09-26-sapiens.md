Sweeping generalizations and factual inaccuracies pepper this book that manages
to somehow be both far too long and not really detailed. The book trots out a
number of strange examples that feel out of place, and the numerous diagrams are
comically simplistic.

The book's opening has a lot of promise and asks and answers interesting
evolutionary questions: what made <em>Homo Sapiens</em> successful and break
apart after many years of stagnation in the pre-Cambrian? Harari's answer is the
"Cognitive Revolution" or the ability to create collectively shared myths, such
as corporations and religions.

Following this, though, the book falls short. It loses track of any argument
that it was trying to make, and engages in broad reductionism that glosses over
interesting details in favor of bland and trite ideas. 

The scope of the book is so broad that when you read something that you
inevitably don't know much about, the insights initially seem interesting, but
all of that is undermined when you get to a section that covers something you
may have studied a bit more and realize that the analysis being done, if there
is any, boils down essentially to "we live in a society."
