From precognition to cultural warfare via board games, Dick's strength as a creative force is obvious in this collection of stories. The prose isn't perfect and the stories occasionally end abruptly or with obvious twists, but on the whole the raw ingenuity of the ideas fuel each story. It's no surprise that two of the stories from this collection were ultimately made into films; his ideas about war, violence, and memory are unique and make his works essential reading.
