It seems like Stephenson was in the middle of writing one book and then decided
to write a second one instead, and the combination results in a sort greatest
hits of annoying techno-libertarianism. What if, the book supposes, the greatest
problem is that we all die, and despite the fact that society is collapsing
around us, we should just trust the tech billionaires to innovate us out of the
issue by creating a simulation of reality? It's a bit much.
