There are a number of things that stand out in this novel about Shaker Heights,
a wealthy suburb of Cleveland. The most compelling to me is the way that Ng so
clearly captures the neurosis of the way that the suburbs are planned and
experienced. Small details enhance this: the adults are only ever known by their
last names when they are grown there; we only get their first names when they
are outside Shaker or in conversation with other adults, though the narrator
continues to refer to them as Mr./Mrs. Everything is in its specific place, and
the range of acceptable experiences are thinned to a point where it is nearly
impossible to consider anything out what you see every day. The book spends
quite a while luxuriously building out this specifically American,
late-capitalism moment, and it pays off down the line. Ng clearly captures the
way that this setting creates a deep and uncomfortable tension in its
characters: people who consider themselves progressive and altruistic become
cruel and vindictive when things intrude on their peaceful and quiet way of
life.

Ng uses two other writing techniques to great effect. She quickly shifts between
characters points of view across her writing, creating unresolvable tension by
having characters experience events with different subsets of information,
leading to people reacting in ways that, while totally understandable given what
they think they know, are absolutely unreasonable given the complete picture.
The other thing that she does is create depth in her characters by briefly
shifting the setting into the future ("she would remember this moment eleven
years later"), allowing her presumably older and wiser characters to reflect on
something with continued bemusement.

The event that surrounds the story of _Little Fires Everywhere_ (the burning down
of the Richardson's house) does not really resolve the fundamental tension in
the book. There is an almost Marxist construction in the fundamental shape of
the story: the thesis of the Richardsons meets its antithesis in Mia, and the
contradiction cannot hold which creates the fire. Of course, the result is not
a synthesis or something new. Perhaps ironically, the Richardsons rebuild their
house, Mia and Pearl move on, and things seem to continue on just as they were
before. What are we to make of this? Has late capitalism evolved to simply
consume contradictions, as Naomi Klein suggests in _No Logo_? It's certainly
interesting to consider.
