Leckie continues to take some risks in her writing. In her widely acclaimed 
*Ancillary Justice* trilogy, she manages to work with a character that is
simultaneously a single being and a member of collective entity. This leads to a
lot of very fascinating concepts, especially as the main character loses all of
her collective selves except for one.

One of the things that makes that so compelling and work so well is that the
book is narrated in the first person. In the case of *Provenance*, set in the
same universe as the *Ancillary* trilogy but not directly related to it, the
narration is done in a close third person style. This choice makes some of the
decisions jarring: who is the narrator, and to whom are they telling the story?
Why does the narrator jump between the invented neutral "e" pronoun and "she"
instead of sticking to one?

Another difference to *Ancillary* is that the writing in *Provenance* is a lot
less subtle. Interesting ideas that might have come out naturally through events
or introspection are instead just shoved right at the readers. 

Overall, the book was enjoyable: it's a fun adventure in space, but it comes up
short of Leckie's previous work.
