Though individual chapters can be uneven, there are a few standout chapters which warrant this book a five-star rating. The first chapter provides a cogent thesis of conservatism, well and briefly defined. The chapters covering Ayn Rand and Antonin Scalia stand out from the rest as well. I envision returning to individual sections of this book many times.
