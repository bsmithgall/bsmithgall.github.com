It's been almost 60 years since Jacobs first published this seminal work of
sociology and urban planning, and much of it still rings true. I was surprised
to learn that the New York City of 1961 was not [that much smaller][1] than it
is today in absolute population terms.

There are a number of fascinating observations that Jacobs make that I think are
quite salient and I wonder how she would recommend we proceed in the modern era.
It seems as though the problem of "cataclysmic money" that marks much new
development in New York has only gotten more aggressive over time. "Mixed use"
also seems to have largely lost the main purpose that she was describing in this
book, now it seems like a way to sneak in more small-unit family-unfriendly
luxury housing.

Speaking of luxury housing, this is one of a number of urban-planning related
pieces I have learned from recently. Others of note are this [long and
often overwrought][2] lamentation about New York City by Kevin Baker in
*Harper's* magazine and the wonderful [Power, Planning, & Politics][3] series
over on YouTube. This last one is especially interesting in with the ways that
cars and freeways choke off and kill neighborhoods and communities.

Taking these things all together and thinking about them in the context of New
York, where I live now, what Jacobs identifies as a primary way to ensure a
diversity of resident incomes in a district is no longer valid. She writes a
whole chapter on how neighborhoods need a mixture of old and new buildings in
order to ensure that the neighborhood has a diversity of structural styles and
to pull in people from different income brackets. However, now that young people
are rushing back to cities, apartments and homes both old and new are
unaffordable in neighborhoods close to the city. Neighborhoods further out are
becoming less affordable all the time. The solutions Jacobs proposes towards the
end of her book around "guaranteed rents" do not seems like they would solve
this core affordability problem, which would dramatically change how cities
would be able to ensure the all-important diversity of uses in their
neighborhoods.

There are so many other interesting questions and ideas raised by Jacobs' work.
Can the informal community surveillance be used to create safety in other
contexts? Acknowledging weakness in the way we organize ourselves to govern
today, what better ways might exist to organize and govern cities? Is it
possible to stop successfully diverse communities from strangling themselves
with their successes? Jacobs doesn't necessarily provide all the answers to
these questions, but the book is worth reading just to see how she approaches
them, and what all has changed since she originally published the book.
