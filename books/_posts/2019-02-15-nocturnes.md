A collection of short stories that are obsessed with nostalgia for the 40s, and
deal only cursorily with music. The writing is plainspoken and often flat. It
feels a bit like something is missing. The best of the bunch is the last one:
"Cellists" which revolves around the mania of self-appointed genius. I was
surprised to learn that Ishiguro himself was an aspiring musician before he
turned to writing.
