Though the writing is a bit weaker than some of Vonnegut's later books, I still
enjoyed this one tremendously. There are some sections that don't make a lot of
sense, but overall it's a cry out for purpose in an increasingly automated
world: from where do we draw meaning?

It's also incredibly prescient of Vonnegut, writing in 1952, to describe what
happens when huge parts of the economy vanish under a scourge of automation. I
was surprised to learn, after reading this book, that Vonnegut considered
himself a socialist. In the book though, the apparatus of automation is owned by
a large national corporation that controls all production, relegating the
remainder of society to the "Reeks and Wrecks" or the army (which appears to be
the last vestige of the state). 

Overall, I really like *Player Piano*, especially reading in concert with Jill
Lepore's recent [piece][robots] in the New Yorker about how robots aren't
actually coming for our jobs.
