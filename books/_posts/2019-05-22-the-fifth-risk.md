Michael Lewis has a real knack for prose -- one of his reviewers claims that he
would read a 4,000 page history of the stapler were it written by Lewis, and
it's easy to understand why. Lewis surely has a knack for humanizing and
explaining complex problems.

Reflecting on my time in government, Lewis has found some of the same behaviors:
the government does all sorts of critical things, but it does it quietly and
behind the scenes. In some cases, I learned, there are instances where the
government is expressly forbidding from advertising their expertise. Lewis makes
an interesting observation that contrasts the relative popularity of NASA
against the far less well-known NOAA, and attributes part of the different to
the fact that NASA is not forbidding by law from doing some basic marketing.

He also does get to the fact that fear of headlines drives a lot of risk-adverse
behavior, especially in the higher-level officials that he spends most of the
book profiling. I have seen examples of this driving agency culture and
decision-making. 

I wish Lewis would spend more time unpacking the titular "Fifth Risk," which is
identified as "project management." He spends a lot of time talking about how
there is no one driving the bus (the vast majority of politically-appointed
positions are still unfilled), but he doesn't really talk about how that affects
the way that 1) agencies choose which projects to pursue and 2) the effect of
not pursuing those projects. This is an area ripe for exploration, especially
on the digital side where much of the actual work is done by contractors.

I hope that this isn't Lewis's last foray into the world of government; there
are so many avenues waiting for exploration by someone with his talent and
reach.
