Fun! Stephenson's obsession with many-worlds theory strikes again, this time
manifesting itself as magic: witches were real and reaching across various
worlds to manifest things into this one. This is the basic premise behind
Stephenson and Galland's joint work. There is a lot to like in this book
which has more of a traditional story structure than previous Stephenson works.
I really enjoyed the many different forms that you find in the book: there are
fictional emails, corporate chats, memos from HR, posts from the internal wiki,
letters, and even a Norse poem.

Since I was traveling when I read the book, I read it on the Kindle which
diminished the experience a bit. I think that all of the various forms that you
find in the book would be better experienced in a physical book.
