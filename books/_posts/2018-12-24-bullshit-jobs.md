Graeber's [original essay from 2013][strike mag] is thought provoking and
deserves a read, but his book along the same lines falls short. The book lives
halfway between a polemic and a more thoroughly researched work and reading it,
you wish that there were more substance behind the claims. 

The majority of the research comes from a number of interviews Graeber conducted
with people who follow him on Twitter. This methodology cries out for deeper
contemplation. There are so many interesting questions raised by the premise and
interviews: if the economy is more "productive" than ever but so many people are
working "bullshit jobs" then what is everyone actually *doing*? Graeber does dig
a bit into some of the statistics available from the BLS, but not enough to
probe meaningfully at this question, which seems important or at the least
interesting.

Perhaps the most interesting new concept introduced by Graeber is "managerial
feudalism." The notion here is that the workplace increasingly resembles the
feudal relationship of the middle ages: the corporate pyramid structure creates
a series of increasingly powerful "lords," each of whom have some number of
serfs.  Given that many of these mid-level "lords" lack any real
responsibilities (according to Graeber), they instead do things like ensure that
people are working (i.e. sitting a desk) sufficient numbers of hours each day.

Graeber's work is interesting, but he doesn't really close in an interesting
way. He instead sort of waves his hands and says "I'm an anarchist!" without
really providing a way forward. That there really isn't a good path forward is
true across a number of modern critiques, including of a second book I read
during my trip: Winners Take All.
