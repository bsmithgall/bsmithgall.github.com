Wonderful and layered in ways similar to and different from <em><a href="/books/my-brilliant-friend">My Brilliant Friend</a></em>,
Ferrante uses Elena's move out of Naples to explore the division between not
just Northern and Southern Italy, long a historical question of interest and
study, but between the wealthy and the poor. As Elena studies in a prestigious
university in Pisa, she struggles to break away from the things that readily
identify her as Neapolitan: she hides her accent and feels great shame
over her threadbare dress and shoes.

Both Elena and Lila realize in the book that there is something more than just
money that separates the two of them from the wealthy: they both struggle with
realizing that there is some ease or confidence that those above them in the
social classes seem to have.

Beyond this, Elena cannot really escape the pull of the <em>stradone</em> and of
Lila's influence, which pull back from her studies &em; Elena often finds
herself attempting to replicate her friends' actions. Even when they spend
significant time apart, Elena finds herself and her emotions bound up by what
she hears and imagines of Lila.
