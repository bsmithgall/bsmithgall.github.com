*The Name of the Rose* is an absolutely wonderful book, much like [Foucault's
Pendulum](books/foucaults-pendulum) it mixes in brilliant, beautiful insight
with long passages of absolutely impenetrable discurses on 14th century abbey
organization and semiotics. It's hard to know if Eco is a genius or a madman, or
perhaps both. Whatever the case may be, he is a tremendous writer. His essay
"[Ur-facism][ur-facism]" remains one of the best essays I have ever read.

Beyond this, though, *The Name of the Rose* contains some absolutely wonderful
passages that relate directly to living today. Long debates about whether or not
heretics are similar or different to each other is a beautiful way to discuss
how people group themselves together and exclude outsiders. William of
Baskerville's monologues about the different kinds of evil present in different
men illuminates behaviors that we see around us in the powerful every day.

Overall, it's a wonderful read and I'm sure to pick it up again.
