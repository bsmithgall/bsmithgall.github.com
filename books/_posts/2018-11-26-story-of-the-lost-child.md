A tremendous conclusion to an absolutely brilliant collection. The ending
perfectly recalls the beginning of the series, and it left me totally
speechless.

Perhaps one of the most fascinating things that Ferrante is able to do in this
latest chapter of the book is to show how the past swallows the present and
future. Elena has spent her whole life removing herself physically and mentally
from the neighborhood, but at the end of the day all of that effort to extract
herself is entirely pointless. The neighborhood catches back up with her. One
tiny accident, misstep, or misstatement can reawaken long-sleeping alliances and
enemies in the complex web of local politics. Even when so many members of the
neighborhood seem to grow in stature (e.g. the Solara brothers), ultimately
everything seems to come back to exactly the way it was. Children becomes their
parents and grandparents and go on to have children that resemble themselves.
History repeats itself, as in the 18th Brumaire.

There are so many interesting critiques of modern society in this latest
installment of Ferrante's: motherhood, success, the petty bourgeoisie, and
intellectual classes are all ruthlessly examined, as they were in previous
chapters.

These are by far the best books I have read this year, and I highly recommend
them to anyone.
