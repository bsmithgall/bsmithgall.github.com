It was a bit of system shock to go from the gargantuan scope of the _Mars_
trilogy to the much smaller _Conversations with Friends_, which perhaps colored
my impressions of the book. I have to say, though, it was sort of difficult to
read a first-person story of a character who seems to think exclusively with the
tone of someone making fun of something on Twitter. In a [profile by the New
York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/world/europe/sally-rooney-ireland.html),
Rooney says that this was intentional:

> Ms. Rooney even gave her character Frances, in “Conversation With Friends,”
> a “Twitter voice,” which she described as “a tone of casual self-revelation
> that deprives others of the ability to criticize.”

The other thing about _Conversations with Friends_ is that all of the characters
are a bit, well, too smart:

> I concluded that some kinds of reality have an unrealistic effect, which made
> me think of the theorist Jean Baudrillard, though I had never read his books
> and these were probably not the issues his writing addressed.

This bit in the book follows an observation by Frances of something "real" (in
this case, a shirt tag) intruding on something imagined (the play). Baudrillard
was a post-structuralist, who argued that symbols have effectively replaced
meaning in society and was also a big booster of his own work, which makes this
a nice little reference to the author.

A few pages later (Roony doesn't use quotation marks to denote speakers):

> How's your mother holding up?
>
> Oh it's migraine season again. We're all tiptoeing around like fucking
> Trappist monks. How was the play?

This is exemplary of a wider trend: it seems like Frances and Bobbi are unable
to have a conversation without someone saying something smart like this. In
comparison to, for example, the Neapolitan Novels, it can just feel a bit
overbearing.
