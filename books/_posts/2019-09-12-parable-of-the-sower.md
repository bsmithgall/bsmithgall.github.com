It's funny to have read this immediately on the heels of
[_Fall_](/books/dodge), because the worlds that they start from don't
actually sound that different from each other. What separates them, though, is
who Stephenson and Butler focus on, and how those characters create and realize
change. For Stephenson, the interesting people are those who have enough money
that they can create massive social media hoaxes about fake nuclear attacks, and
the solution is to build a giant high-fantasy simulation that we can all live in
when we die. 

For Butler, the focus is instead on a normal girl, part of a middle-class family
that is trying to make do as the world crumbles around them. Though it was
written in 1993, it is striking the degree it reflects the current moment. From
small details like an outbreak of measles in New York and New Jersey to bigger
plot points where the group is trying to escape from a raging fire, the book
shows us a future not entirely divorced from our current trajectory. 

Inside this, though, is the main character's undeniable hope: things can
improve. We can build a better tomorrow.
