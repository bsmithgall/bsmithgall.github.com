Truly a classic, and extremely thought provoking in a way that many other books
attempt to be unsuccessfully. One of Dick's many concerns in his giant body of
work is around what is and is not real and true. In this case, he is most
concerned with the edge between humanity and computers. This is an especially
interesting debate today. For Dick, at least in this book, the primary concern
is about empathy: what divides humans from machines is the speed of an empathic
response.

Of course, this is all tremendously complicated by the fact that there are
people whose exposure to the toxic fallout of post-apocalyptic Los Angeles make
them fail the tests that are used for androids. In _Do Androids Dream_, Dick
points out that these characters are in fact not human, labeled as "specials" by
those who can still pass the tests. Additionally, the robot manufacturing
companies in the book continue to churn out new models that force the tests to
be re-evaluated. At some point, the implication goes, they will produce a model
that will be totally indistinguishable from humans in ever way imaginable,
except that they will die after only two years of life. What is the different at
that point?

The other incredible thing about Dick's writing, which is certainly present
here, are the little objects that collect in his worlds. In this case, the
wonderful "Penfield Mood Organ," which allows you to "dial" up a mood (like the
desire to watch TV no matter what is on or a feeling of new resolve and
purpose), or the "empathy box" which you use to gain collective transcendental
religious experience. These little ideas wrapped in objects can be very
thought-provoking and often prophetic. How dissimilar are these imagined objects
from forms and functions of modern consumer electronics?
