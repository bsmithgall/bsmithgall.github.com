The *Culture* novels were recommended to me by a friend and I finally got a
chance to read one of them while traveling. There's a fairly expansive set of
books covering all of *Culture*, and this one was recommended to me as a good
starting place.

Overall, it's a pretty interesting story with hooks into the greater universe,
but occasionally poor writing and flat character development breaks the story's
immersion.  Banks has a tendency to have his characters think obviously deep
thoughts, while someone like Ursula K. Le Guin will be able to discuss ideas in
more subtle and interesting ways. For example, in The Left Hand of Darkness, she
has her main character Genly explore around an alien world. As he travels, you
share his wonder at discovery and intrigue, as opposed to having him think deep
thoughts or give profound speeches.

As a general concept though, the notion that culture can be reduced into a game,
or a game can perfectly mimic a society is interesting. There are a number of
other books that I read on the trip where this idea is reflected: *The Luzhin
Defense* shows how this sort of worldview leads to madness. *Winners Take All*
explores the ways in which modern capitalism has been reduced into a game in
some ways with fixed rules (the so-called "protocols") and obvious victors.

There are some interesting wrinkles in the *Culture* series that make the series
worth exploring more broadly, so I will probably return to it in the future.
