Tremendously interesting and often funny, this form-bending history/fiction
describes the years when it seemed as thought the Soviet Union was poised to
plan its way past the United States and create a world of plenty for its people.
Spufford does this work by splitting up the book into a number of sections that
are all introduced by non-fiction, and then having fictional or quasi-fictional
scenes that demonstrate the ideas laid out in the introductory sections.

The book, all in all, is quite sad! It's a tale about mass delusion followed
immediately by mass disillusion. Spufford, though, brings this story to life
with well-considered descriptions and interesting turns of phrase.

All in all, I really enjoyed the book. The Soviet Union is a fascinating place,
and this book is a wonderful, if fictionalized, version of events that played
out and the ways that people thought about them.
