This is an introduction to quantum mechanics by focusing on the famous "double
slit" experiment which reveals one of the most fundamentally bizarre behaviors
of light: the observation of individual photon particles makes them behave as if
they were waves.

I can't say that I understood everything that goes on in this book, but the
descriptions of some of the experiments themselves make it worth the cost of
admission. My favorite involved a team of researchers setting up a double-slit
variant on top of mountains in Canary Islands to discover that quantum
entanglement seems to, if I understood this correctly, ignore linear time.

The book also goes into the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics: is
it true that there is no reality outside of our measurement of it? Is there some
sort of barrier between the quantum world and the standard world? These are
interesting questions to think about and consider, and it brings to mind a
wonderful Feynman quote from _QED_:

> What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the
> third or fourth year of graduate school... It is my task to convince you not
> to turn away because you don't understand it. You see my physics students
> don't understand it... That is because I don't understand it. Nobody does.
