Slow and steady progress on *The Power Broker*, though I should still be on
track to finish it by the end of the summer. I picked up this much slimmer book
to read while my arms recover from reading the former.

It's another wonderful conspiratorial satire from Eco, though the conspiracy is
smaller in scope than [Foucault's Pendulum](books/foucaults-pendulum), involving
"only" Mussolini, the stay-behinds, the CIA, the mafia, and the Vatican. The
book was published in early 2015 and offers a thin critique of Italy under
Berlusconi. Of course, the send-up of both newspapers and a desire to know an
actual truth about what is or could be happening is relevant in the US today.

I was struck most definitely by the last few paragraphs, when the loser
narrator, Colonna, is discussing running away with his much younger love
interest, Maia. This takes place after they watch a BBC documentary that reveals
that much of the elaborate conspiracy theory they had been concerned about over
the past few pages:

> Didn't you see that all of those interviewed [in the BBC documentary] were
> happily telling us what they'd done and were almost expecting a medal for it? No
> more Baroque chiaroscuro, everything in broad daylight, as though painted by the
> impressionists: corruption rife, Mafiosi officially in parliament, tax dodgers
> in government, and the only ones to end up in prison are Albanian chicken
> thieves.

With this kind of corruption everywhere, what can they do except find dull work
and take in films on the weekend?
