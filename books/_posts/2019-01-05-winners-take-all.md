Giridharadas notes all the way in the appendix that he fits very well into
MarketWorld, having worked at [McKinsey][mckinsey], spoken at Ted, and received
a number of the fellowships that he decries in the book. That being said, his
criticisms are well-founded, especially around philanthropy. His critique of the
[Gospel of Wealth][gospel] is not necessarily new, but some of the criticisms of
the philanthropy are.

Perhaps the weakest part of the book is that there really isn't a lot of though
given into how we move forward. Part of his case is that MarketWorld has become
such an effective way of thinking because it has supplanted the role of
government. Culturally, we have decided that we don't want to support democratic
institutions and instead want to trust "business," but Giridharadas does a lot
of work to show that "business thinking" falls short, especially when it comes
to philanthropy and governance. He says that he prefers democratic and
governmental solutions, but simultaneously admits that those solutions are not
really feasible given that the public no longer supports them. So where does
this leave us? What are we supposed to do? How can we possibly oppose or
question MarketWorld, given how powerful its leaders are, and how clearly they
disregard or absorb criticism.

The book makes me think a bit about Naomi Klein's work, especially some of what
she hints at in No Logo: as we moved into the 21st century, corporations became
more nimble and able to re-purpose criticism into their own advertising. I
wonder if Giridharadas's work will be expropriated in the same way by
MarketWorld types.
