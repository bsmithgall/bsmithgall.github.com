I love Anathem; I think it's a wonderful example of what I love about
Stephenson's books. He takes a Big Ideaâ„¢ and constructs an entire world around
it. The Ideas in this book are [Platonic epistemology and forms][plato], and the
[many-worlds][many worlds] view of the cosmos, which I think Stephenson is
[somewhat obsessed with][obsessed] (it turns out to be an important part of the
other Stephenson book I read on vacation, Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.).

Like many of Stephenson's books, it's a lot of work and takes some time to get
going. A number of interesting diversions don't help with the pacing. Many pages
are spent on a number of largely meaningless distractions that might
alternatively madden or interest a reader. This is, though, part of what makes
reading Stephenson so unlike reading almost anyone else: who else would dedicate
a long aside to an [aperiodic tiling problem][tiling] or include three fictional
Socratic dialogues as appendices? Where else do you find a first-contact story
to be an excuse for a quantum exploration of Platonic forms? 

This was the third or fourth time I've read Anathem, and I look forward to
getting more out of it for years to come.
