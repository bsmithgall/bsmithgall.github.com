The Illustrated Man is a collection of Bradbury's older stories that I was given
in Minneapolis when I attended [SRCCON's](https://srccon.org) sci-fi book swap.
Bradbury is often regarded as one of the three true founders of science fiction,
along with Asimov and Clarke, but I don't think this particular set of stories
aged particularly well. There are a handful of standouts here, (I though that
_The Veldt_ and _Zero Hour_ were quite good, along with _The Fox and the
Forest_), but overall I thought that the collection hasn't aged particularly
well.
